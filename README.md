# Hang_Man
Simple Hang Man game made in Java

This was made as a fun project to make and play. The current version of the game is very challenging due to only 10 wrong guesses allowed and very hard dictionary of words.

To change the pool from which words are selected simply edit the included words.txt file or replace it with one of the same name. Make sure it is in the same folder as the source code.
